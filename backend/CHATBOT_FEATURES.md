Bot: "Hey coach! üëã Looking at today's attendance, you have 8 out of 12 players present. 
     Missing today are: John Smith, Mike Johnson, and David Wilson. 
     Want me to send them a reminder message?"
```

### Match Analysis
```
User: "How did we do in the last game?"
Bot: "Great question! Looking at your recent match against Thunder FC, 
     you won 3-1! üéâ Your team showed excellent possession (65%) and 
     created 12 chances. The goals came from your striker Alex in the 
     23rd and 67th minutes, plus a penalty from your captain Tom. 
     Your defense was solid too - only 3 shots on target against you!"
```

### Tactical Advice
```
User: "What formation should I use against a strong attacking team?"
Bot: "For facing a strong attacking team, I'd recommend a 4-5-1 or 3-5-2 formation. 
     The 4-5-1 gives you solid defensive coverage while maintaining 
     counter-attacking potential. Your midfield trio of Sarah, James, 
     and Carlos would work perfectly in this setup. 
     Want me to show you some specific drills for this formation?"
```

### Internet Search
```
User: "What's the latest transfer news?"
Bot: "Let me check the latest transfer updates for you! üîç
     According to recent reports, Manchester City is close to signing 
     a new midfielder, and there are rumors about your league rival 
     Thunder FC looking at a striker from the lower division. 
     This could affect your upcoming match strategy!"
